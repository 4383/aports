Subject: [PATCH] have configure check/add --gc-sections linker option

this allowing the linker to drop certain weak definitions that are
only used as dummies for static linking. they could be eliminated for
shared library builds using the preprocessor instead, but we are
trying to transition to using the same object files for shared and
static libc, so a link-time solution is preferable.
